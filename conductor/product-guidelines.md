# Product Guidelines - AI Reader

## Visual Identity & UX
- **Focused & Minimal:** The interface should prioritize the text, with UI elements receding when not in use.
- **Classic Typography:** Use high-quality serif fonts for reading and clean sans-serif fonts for the interface.
- **Soft Palette:** Use a "paper" or "sepia" toned background by default to reduce eye strain during long reading sessions.
- **Material Design Principles:** Utilize clean lines, subtle shadows, and intuitive interactions for a modern feel.

## Tone & Voice
- **Approachable Expertise:** The AI assistant should be knowledgeable but speak in clear, modern English.
- **Empathetic & Encouraging:** Interactions should feel supportive, especially when explaining complex or archaic passages.
- **Direct & Concise:** Avoid unnecessary jargon; provide value quickly to keep the reader focused on the book.

## AI Interaction Guidelines
- **Context Awareness:** AI responses should always consider the current page and any selected text.
- **Transparency:** Clearly indicate when a summary or explanation is AI-generated.
- **Action-Oriented:** Focus on helping the user understand the text, rather than just providing abstract facts.

## Design Patterns
- **Pagination:** Emulate a physical book with distinct pages rather than a continuous scroll.
- **Non-Intrusive Tools:** Highlights and notes should be easily accessible but not clutter the reading area.
- **Seamless Navigation:** The Table of Contents and progress tracking should be a single click away.
