# Product Guidelines - AI Reader

## Visual Identity & UX
- **Focused & Minimal:** The interface should prioritize the text, with UI elements receding when not in use.
- **Bauhaus Aesthetic:** Embrace a "Modern Minimalist" look characterized by bold geometric shapes, sharp corners (no border-radius), and massive sans-serif typography for navigation and headers.
- **Monochromatic Palette:** Use a strict black, white, and gray UI base, allowing colorful book covers and specific bold accents (like Bauhaus Red) to pop.
- **Functional Grid:** Maintain a strict, uniform layout with generous whitespace and clear hierarchy.

## Tone & Voice
- **Approachable Expertise:** The AI assistant should be knowledgeable but speak in clear, modern English.
- **Empathetic & Encouraging:** Interactions should feel supportive, especially when explaining complex or archaic passages.
- **Direct & Concise:** Avoid unnecessary jargon; provide value quickly to keep the reader focused on the book.

## AI Interaction Guidelines
- **Context Awareness:** AI responses should always consider the current page and any selected text.
- **Transparency:** Clearly indicate when a summary or explanation is AI-generated.
- **Verifiability:** Provide interactive citations for AI claims, allowing users to instantly jump to and highlight the source text in the reader.
- **Action-Oriented:** Focus on helping the user understand the text, rather than just providing abstract facts.

## Design Patterns
- **Pagination:** Emulate a physical book with distinct pages rather than a continuous scroll.
- **Non-Intrusive Tools:** Highlights and notes should be easily accessible but not clutter the reading area.
- **Seamless Navigation:** The Table of Contents and progress tracking should be a single click away.
